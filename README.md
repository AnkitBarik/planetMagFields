# planetMagFields
Routines to plot magnetic fields of planets in our solar system

## Use
#### For a single planet

```
$ ./magField <planet name>
```
The planet name is case insensitive. For example:
```
$ ./magField earth
```

#### All planets

```
$ ./magField all
```

would produce a plot of all magnetic field maps of different planets in a single figure
along with a table of information about dipole tilt for each.
